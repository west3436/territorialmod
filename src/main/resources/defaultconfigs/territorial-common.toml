# Territorial Mod - Event Control Configuration
# 
# This file allows you to configure where certain game events can occur based on:
# - Biome types (specific biome IDs)
# - Biome temperatures (temperature ranges)
# - Coordinates (x/y/z coordinate ranges)
# - Dimensions (specific dimension IDs)
#
# By default, all events are ALLOWED everywhere. Add rules below to restrict events.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is a reference/example. The actual rules should be configured
# using TOML format in separate configuration files. This will be fully implemented
# in Phase 1.3 (Configuration Parser).
#
# Configuration File Structure (TOML format):
# 
# [plant_growth]
#     [[plant_growth.rules]]
#         enabled = true
#         biomes = ["minecraft:desert", "minecraft:badlands"]
#         temperature_min = 0.5
#         temperature_max = 2.0
#         x_min = -1000
#         x_max = 1000
#         y_min = 60
#         y_max = 120
#         z_min = -1000
#         z_max = 1000
#         crop_types = ["minecraft:wheat", "minecraft:carrots"]
#         allow = false  # false = block growth, true = allow growth
#
# [animal_breeding]
#     [[animal_breeding.rules]]
#         enabled = true
#         biomes = ["minecraft:plains", "minecraft:forest"]
#         animal_types = ["minecraft:cow", "minecraft:sheep"]
#         allow = true
#
# [mineral_veins]
#     [[mineral_veins.rules]]
#         enabled = true
#         vein_types = ["copper", "iron"]
#         biomes = ["minecraft:mountains"]
#         integration = "immersive_engineering"  # or "create"
#         allow = true
#
# Field Descriptions:
#
# enabled (boolean)         - Whether this rule is active
# allow (boolean)           - true = allow event, false = block event
# biomes (list of strings)  - Biome IDs (e.g., "minecraft:desert", "minecraft:plains")
# temperature_min (float)   - Minimum biome temperature (-2.0 to 2.0)
# temperature_max (float)   - Maximum biome temperature (-2.0 to 2.0)
# x_min, x_max (integer)    - X coordinate range (inclusive)
# y_min, y_max (integer)    - Y coordinate range (inclusive)
# z_min, z_max (integer)    - Z coordinate range (inclusive)
# dimension (string)        - Dimension ID (e.g., "minecraft:overworld", "minecraft:the_nether")
# crop_types (list)         - Crop types for plant growth rules
# animal_types (list)       - Animal types for breeding rules
# vein_types (list)         - Vein/ore types for mineral rules
# integration (string)      - "immersive_engineering" or "create" for mineral rules
#
# Rule Precedence:
# - More specific rules override general rules
# - Coordinate restrictions > Temperature restrictions > Biome restrictions
# - Explicit deny overrides explicit allow at the same specificity level
# - If no rules match, the event is ALLOWED by default
#
# Examples:
#
# Example 1: Prevent wheat growth in hot biomes (temperature > 1.0)
# [[plant_growth.rules]]
#     enabled = true
#     temperature_min = 1.0
#     crop_types = ["minecraft:wheat"]
#     allow = false
#
# Example 2: Prevent animal breeding above Y=150
# [[animal_breeding.rules]]
#     enabled = true
#     y_min = 150
#     allow = false
#
# Example 3: Only allow copper veins in mountain biomes (Immersive Engineering)
# [[mineral_veins.rules]]
#     enabled = true
#     vein_types = ["copper"]
#     biomes = ["minecraft:mountains"]
#     integration = "immersive_engineering"
#     allow = true
#
# Example 4: Block all crop growth in a specific coordinate region
# [[plant_growth.rules]]
#     enabled = true
#     x_min = 0
#     x_max = 1000
#     z_min = 0
#     z_max = 1000
#     allow = false
#
# Note: Full configuration parser and loader will be implemented in Phase 1.3
# This file serves as documentation for the configuration format.
#
# Dynmap Integration:
#
# If you have Dynmap-Forge installed, Territorial can automatically visualize
# your rules on the dynamic map as colored polygons.
#
# - Rules with coordinate bounds (x_min, x_max, z_min, z_max) appear as regions
# - Click regions on the map to see rule details in a popup
# - Color scheme:
#   * GREEN   = Plant growth allowed
#   * RED     = Plant growth denied
#   * BLUE    = Animal breeding allowed
#   * ORANGE  = Animal breeding denied
#   * YELLOW  = Mineral veins allowed
#   * PURPLE  = Mineral veins denied
#
# To enable Dynmap integration:
# 1. Install Dynmap-Forge (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynmapforge)
# 2. Ensure enableDynmapIntegration = true in config/territorial-common.toml
# 3. Rules automatically appear on the map
# 4. Use /territorial reload to refresh markers after config changes
#
# Note: Only rules with coordinate bounds are shown on the map.
# Biome-only or temperature-only rules work in-game but don't appear on Dynmap.
